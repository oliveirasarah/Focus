# Isis - Task Manager

**Isis** is a task manager for Web, all your tasks are saved locally, so you don't have to worry about logging in for now, although that option might be added in the future.

This project was inspired by the [MinimaList App](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/minimalist-to-do-list-task/id993066159), that is no longer available for Android. 

I intend to make an Mobile version soon.
