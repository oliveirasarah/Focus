# Focus - Minimal task manager

<div style="display: inline" align="center">
<img src="/img/Focus.png">
<img src="/img/Focus-dark.png">
</div>

All your tasks are saved locally, so you don't have to worry about logging in for now, although that option might be added in the future.

## It also works on your phone:

<div style="display: inline" align="center">
<img src="/img/Focus-mobile.png">

</div>
